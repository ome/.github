OME is a consortium of universities, research labs, industry and developers
producing open-source software and format standards for microscopy data. If you are working with bioimaging data
like _these_:

then you may already be using something from OME!  _(You can find out more about these images on <https://idr.openmicroscopy.org>.)_

* [OME Model](https://github.com/ome/ome-model) [![GitHub stars](https://badgen.net/github/stars/ome/ome-model)](https://GitHub.com/ome/ome-model/stargazers/)
  At the core of everything we do is the specification of an open data model, a vocabulary, that lets software components and users exchange bioimaging (meta)data.
* [Bio-Formats](https://github.com/ome/bioformats) [![GitHub stars](https://badgen.net/github/stars/ome/bioformats)](https://GitHub.com/ome/bioformats/stargazers/)
  is a library translate hundreds of bioimaging formats into the common model.
* [OMERO](https://github.com/ome/openmicroscopy) [![GitHub stars](https://badgen.net/github/stars/ome/openmicroscopy)](https://GitHub.com/ome/openmicroscopy/stargazers/)
  is a data management platform that uses Bio-Formats to serve all supported formats to your users, through:
  - the [OMERO.web](https://github.com/ome/omero-web) [![GitHub stars](https://badgen.net/github/stars/ome/omero-web)](https://GitHub.com/ome/omero-web/stargazers/) client,
  - the [OMERO.insight](https://github.com/ome/omero-insight) [![GitHub stars](https://badgen.net/github/stars/ome/omero-insight)](https://GitHub.com/ome/omero-insight/stargazers/) Java client, or
  - the OMERO.cli written using the [OMERO.py](https://github.com/ome/omero-py) [![GitHub stars](https://badgen.net/github/stars/ome/omero-py)](https://GitHub.com/ome/omero-py/stargazers/) API.
  - The are also [ansible roles](https://github.com/orgs/ome/repositories?q=ansible-role&type=&language=&sort=) and [docker images](https://github.com/orgs/ome/repositories?q=docker&type=&language=&sort=)
    available to help you manage your OMERO server.
* [OME-NGFF](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest), next-generation file formats. See:
  - [ngff](https://github.com/ome/ngff) [![GitHub stars](https://badgen.net/github/stars/ome/ngff)](https://GitHub.com/ome/ngff/stargazers/) for the specification
  - [ome-zarr-py](https://github.com/ome/ome-zarr-py) [![GitHub stars](https://badgen.net/github/stars/ome/ome-zarr-py)](https://GitHub.com/ome/ome-zarr-py/stargazers/) for the Python implementation
